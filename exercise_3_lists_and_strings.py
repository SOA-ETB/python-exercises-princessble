#Exercise 3: Lists and Strings

# 1. Create the variables
# numbers: a list of 3 integers
numbers = [3, 7, 21]

#strings: a single string that contains "hello" and "world"
strings = "hello world"  #you could also use "hello, world"

#names: a list with at least 3 strings
names = ["Sam", "Blessing", "Ayman"]

#2. Print the full list of numbers
print("numbers:", numbers)


#3 print strings
print("strings:", strings)

#4. Print the second name in the names list
#lists are zero indexed, so index 1  is the second item.

print("second name:", names[1])
